<p>We do not allow the sharing of sexually intimate images of someone without their permission—also called non-consensual intimate imagery, or NCII. We do not allow NCII to be distributed on our services, nor do we allow any content that praises, supports, or request NCII.</p>
<p>In general, if a video or image has the following traits, we treat it as NCII:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was taken privately, not in a professional setting.</li>
<li>It shows sexual activity, nudity, or a sexualized body part. </li>
<li>The person shown in the imagery didn’t agree to either the creation or the sharing of the imagery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Microsoft does not allow any threats to share or publish NCII—also called intimate extortion. This includes asking for or threatening a person to get money, images, or other value things in exchange for not making the NCII public. </p>
<h3 id="sexual-solicitation">Sexual solicitation</h3>
<p>We do not allow people to use its products and services to ask for or offer sex, sexual services, or sexual content in exchange for money or something else of value.</p>
<h3 id="suicide-and-self-injury">Suicide and self-injury</h3>
<p>We work to remove any content about suicide and self-harm that could be dangerous. We also know that people may use our services to talk about mental health, share their stories, or join groups with others who have been affected by suicide or self-injury.</p>
<p>This includes the following (without limitation):</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting general ways people can end their lives, such as with a gun, hanging, or drug overdose.</li>
<li>Encouraging someone to take their life.</li>
<li>Showing images of real or attempted suicide.</li>
<li>Praising those who have died by suicide for taking their own life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Self-injury content demonstrates, praises, or inspires physical harm to oneself, including through cutting, burning, or carving one’s skin. It also includes content that encourages or instructs on eating disorders, or systematic over or under-eating.</p>
<h3 id="terrorism-and-violent-extremism">Terrorism and violent extremism</h3>
<p>We do not allow content that praises or supports terrorists or violent extremists, helps them to recruit, or encourages or enables their activities. We look to the United Nations Security Council’s Consolidated List to identify terrorists or terrorist groups. Violent extremists include people who embrace an ideology of violence or violent hatred towards another group.</p>
<p>We will delete the Microsoft Learn account of any user posting terrorism and violent extremism content.</p>
<h3 id="trafficking">Trafficking</h3>
<p>We do not allow any content that perpetrates human trafficking. Trafficking happens when someone exploits someone else for personal gain by depriving them of their human rights.</p>
<p>Trafficking commonly includes three parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The act of recurring, moving, relocating, paying for, or abducting people.</li>
<li>The use of—or threat of—force, lies, trickery, or coercion to do these activities.</li>
<li>The activities are done for money, status, or some other kind of gain.</li>
</ul>
<p>Trafficking includes forcing people to work, marry, engage in sexual activity, or have medical treatments or operations without their consent and is not limited to any age or background.</p>
<h3 id="violent-threats-incitement-and-glorification-of-violence">Violent threats, incitement, and glorification of violence</h3>
<p>We do not permit content that encourages violence against other people through violent threats or incitement.</p>
<p>Threats of violence are words that show a specific intention to cause someone serious physical harm.</p>
<p>Incitement is material that encourages, urges, or is likely to result in serious physical harm to a person or group.</p>
<p>We also do not allow the glorification of violence through content that praises or supports real acts of violence causing serious physical harm to people or groups, including violence that happened in the past.</p>
<h3 id="adult-and-sexual">Adult and sexual</h3>
<p>We do not allow the use of the Services to generate or share inappropriate content or material (involving, for example, nudity, bestiality, pornography, offensive language, graphic violence, self-harm, or criminal activity).</p>
<h3 id="profanity-and-vulgarity">Profanity and vulgarity</h3>
<p>We do not allow swearing or any other dismissive language.</p>
<h3 id="spam">Spam</h3>
<p>We do not allow spam or any posts that engage in phishing or the generation or distribution of malware.</p>
<p>Spam is unwanted or unsolicited bulk email, postings, contact requests, SMS (text messages), instant messages, or similar electronic communications.</p>
<p>Phishing is sending emails or other electronic communications to fraudulently or unlawfully induce recipients to reveal personal or sensitive information to gain access to accounts or records, exfiltration of documents or other sensitive information, payment and/or financial benefit.</p>
<p>Malware includes any activity designed to cause technical harm, such as delivering malicious executables, organizing denial of service attacks, or managing command and control servers.</p>
<h3 id="defamation-impersonation-false-information">Defamation, impersonation, false information</h3>
<p>We do not allow any activities that are fraudulent, false, or misleading (e.g., asking for money under false pretenses, impersonating someone else, defamation, manipulating the Services to increase play count, or affect rankings, ratings, or comments).</p>
